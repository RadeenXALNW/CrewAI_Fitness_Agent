By using Browserless locally with Docker, you can simulate website functionalities seamlessly. If Docker isnâ€™t installed yet, do so by following the installation instructions online as it is an essential developer tool.
So, when you have docker, run this:

```
docker run -d --rm --name browserless -p 3000:3000 browserless/chrome
```

***Make sure below two packages have these two versions.***

 - crewai  Version: 0.11.2
 - pydantic Version: 2.7.0
```
pip show crewai pydantic
```
Make sure to set your all environment variables and API keys. 
```
export variable_name=<api_key>
export model_name=<model_name>
```
Now run the main.py and play with it :shipit:
```
poetry run python main.py
